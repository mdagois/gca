# Assets

This folder contains all the graphics assets used in the samples.
The assets are converted by using the conversion tools from the [tools/conv](../tools/conv) folder at the root of the repository.
A batch file to convert all assets, [build_assets.bat](build_assets.bat), is available for Windows.
