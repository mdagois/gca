# Assets

This folder contains all the graphics assets used in the samples.
Converted assets are available [here](../prebuilt/assets).
You can convert the assets by using the conversion tools from the [tools/conv](../tools/conv) folder at the root of the repository.
A batch file, [build_assets.bat](build_assets.bat), to convert all assets is available for Windows.
