# Game Boy Coding Adventure

This is the companion repository for the book [Game Boy Coding Adventure](https://mdagois.gumroad.com/l/CODQn) by [Maximilien Dagois](https://mdagois.gumroad.com/).

The repository contains all the samples, conversion tools, and assets used in the book, as well as some fully commented games.
For convenience, the repository provides the prebuilt and converted files.
* [ROMs](prebuilt/roms) for the samples
* [Windows binaries](bin) for the conversion tools
* A copy of [GNU Make 4.2](bin/make.exe) for Windows
* [ROMs](prebuilt/games) for the games
* [ROM](prebuilt/printer) of the printer simulator
* Converted graphics [assets](prebuilt/assets)

Instructions to build the ROMs and tools, and to convert assets, are available in the repository.
Check the [samples](samples), [tools](tools), [games](games), and [assets](assets) folders for more details.

## License

Most of the content in the repository is licensed under the CC0 1.0 Universal license, available [here](LICENSE.txt).
This includes the [samples](samples), the [games](games), and the [tools](tools).

However, there are three exceptions.

First, the copy of GNU make, available [here](bin/make.exe), is licensed under the GPLv3+.

Second, the [stb_image.h](tools/conv/third_party/stb_image.h) file, from the [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) repository, belongs to the public domain.

Finally, the vast majority of the graphics [assets](assets) are from [Oceans Dream](https://oceansdream.itch.io)'s [Nostalgia Base Pack](https://oceansdream.itch.io/nostalgia-pack).
Some of the assets from the pack were modified to match the purpose of the samples.
You cannot use any of these assets in your own project without buying the pack first.
There are assets from other sources as well.
They all belong to the public domain and were authored by [Armando Montero](https://opengameart.org/users/armm1998), [GX310](https://gx310.itch.io), [Patrick](https://opengameart.org/users/patvanmackelberg), and [Sebastian Riedel](https://opengameart.org/users/ba%C5%9Dto).
